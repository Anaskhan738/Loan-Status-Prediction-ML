# Loan-Status-Prediction-ML
End-to-end ML pipeline for loan approval prediction using Python and Scikit-learn.

This project predicts whether a loan application will be **approved or rejected** based on applicant data such as income, education, and credit history.  

## 📊 Workflow
1. Data Collection & Loading (CSV dataset)  
2. Data Preprocessing (handling missing values, encoding categorical data)  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations  
4. Train-Test Split for model validation  
5. Model Training using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
6. Model Evaluation – Achieved **79.9% training accuracy** and **83.3% test accuracy**  
7. Predictions on new input data  

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Python, Pandas, NumPy  
- Scikit-learn (Support Vector Machine)  
- Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- Google Colab  

## 🚀 Results
- Accuracy on Training Data: **79.9%**
- Accuracy on Test Data: **83.3%**
